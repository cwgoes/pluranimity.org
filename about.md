### Projects

Board member, [Stiftung Anoma](https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-264.379.335). Cofounder, [Heliax](https://heliax.dev).

Previously, I worked as a researcher for [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin) and as a cofounder of [Metastate](https://metastate.ch/). A long time ago, I led [CUAUV](https://cuauv.org)'s efforts to teach underwater submarines to recognise circulur buoys and dithered around with [spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07610).
