        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Recently, I’ve been reading some anthropology. The economic canon postulates a primitive economy of barter, where at some point money emerged to solve the problem of double-coincidence-of-wants. This assumption is taken for granted in many places (including, to some degree, in the <a href="https://anoma.net/vision-paper.pdf">original Anoma vision paper</a>), but when you consult the historical record, as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt">David Graeber does</a>, it is clearly bunk. Early societies - and small societies today - didn’t swap cows for chickens, at least not most of the time, and they didn’t invent coins to solve double-coincidence-of-wants because they didn’t need to. Rather, they used credit. Credit solves double-coincidence-of-wants in a beautifully elegant way: by integrating over time. If I’m the butcher, and you’re the baker, I may not need bread right now, but I’ll definitely need some in the future. If we live in the same town, and I expect you to be around for awhile, we can simply keep track of who gave who what when, and settle accounts periodically - this requires, of course, likelihood of repeat interactions and sufficient trust, but in small communities these are both present. Still, comparing goods is often helpful, so such communities often picked a particular good to serve as unit of account (but with the actual exchange being of the specific goods in question). The “store of value” function of money, as it were, was mostly virtual, not physical: although some farmers may have had more cattle or grain than others, the most important asset held by residents was usually the trust of the community, with which they could obtain what they needed when they needed it and could more easily handle shocks to their own supplies. This trust is a form of credit, which anyone could issue whenever they wanted to - but if they started taking too much without providing in return, their neighbors may not want to accept their credit anymore. This kind of credit accounting is virtual, tracked not in exact precision with spreadsheets and central banks, but roughly through observation and gossip, and it is <em>scale-free</em>, in that anyone at any scale of operation - both individuals and institutions (such as the bakery) can issue credit - there is no monopoly on doing so.</p>

          <p>Dashboards for decentralised finance, such as the <a href="https://defipulse.com/">first result on Google for “DeFi”</a>, display and rank protocols by a metric called “Total Value Locked”, which is measured as the amount of tokens locked in the smart contracts or blockchain of the protocol in question multiplied by the current exchange rate of the token against a fiat currency, most commonly USD. Protocols usually compete for TVL with some mix of printing tokens in return for locking other tokens in the protocol (increasing the multiplicand of locked token amount) and content marketing and memetic engineering (increasing demand and thus the multiplier of fiat price). Implicit in the metric of TVL (total <em>value</em> locked), the competition to maximise it, and the broad structure of the decentralised finance ecosystem alike is this assumption that <em>value</em> can be measured and homogenised by price. This assumption is false, and its deep permeation is evidence that the web3 ecosystem has been largely coopted by the very incentive structures which it was originally designed to oppose.</p>
